# Shooting-game
Controlers of a Unity game implemented with Vuforia for a mobile app.

# Implementation
When the target image is recognised a target is rendered on the image. The image rendered includes:
- the powerbar that defines the power selected by user
- a transparent ball in the middle of the target that defines whether the shoot was successful or not.
- a fixed ball that produces a prefab each time a user touches it

# UI
Based on user's performance there two cases, fail or success. A restart button is also available to play again.
